Course Description

Grow your machine learning skills with scikit-learn and discover how to use this popular Python library to train models using labeled data. In this course, you'll learn how to make powerful predictions, such as whether a customer is will churn from your business, whether an individual has diabetes, and even how to tell classify the genre of a song. Using real-world datasets, you'll find out how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, and determine how well they will perform with unseen data.

In this chapter, you'll be introduced to classification problems and learn how to solve them using supervised learning techniques. You'll learn how to split data into training and test sets, fit a model, make predictions, and evaluate accuracy. Youâ€™ll discover the relationship between model complexity and performance, applying what you learn to a churn dataset, where you will classify the churn status of a telecom company's customers.

k-Nearest Neighbors: Fit

In this exercise, you will build your first classification model using the churn_df dataset, which has been preloaded for the remainder of the chapter.

The features to use will be "account_length" and "customer_service_calls". The target, "churn", needs to be a single column with the same number of observations as the feature data.

You will convert the features and the target variable into NumPy arrays, create an instance of a KNN classifier, and then fit it to the data.

numpy has also been preloaded for you as np.


Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors.
Create an array called X containing values from the "account_length" and "customer_service_calls" columns, and an array called y for the values of the "churn" column.
Instantiate a KNeighborsClassifier called knn with 6 neighbors.
Fit the classifier to the data using the .fit() method.

# Import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier 

# Create arrays for the features and the target variable
y = churn_df["churn"].values
X = churn_df[["account_length", "customer_service_calls"]].values

# Create a KNN classifier with 6 neighbors
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the data
knn.fit(X, y)
